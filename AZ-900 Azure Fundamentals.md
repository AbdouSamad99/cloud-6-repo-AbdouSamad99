## 1. Cloud Computing
- **What is cloud computing?**

  It's the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. 
  These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.
  
  -  Cloud computing offers:
    - Faster innovation
    - Flexible resources
    - Economies of scale.

- **Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?**
  - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  - Cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's datacenter.
  - Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them.
  - You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
    - Lower your operating costs.
    - Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
    - Scale as your business needs change.

- **Why should I move to the cloud?**

  In our ever-changing digital world, two trends emerge:
  - Teams deliver new features to their users at record speeds.
  - Users expect an increasingly rich and immersive experience with their devices and with software.
  
  To power your services and deliver innovative and novel user experiences more quickly, the cloud provides on-demand access to:
  - A nearly limitless pool of raw compute, storage, and networking components.
  - Speech recognition and other cognitive services that help make your application stand out from the crowd.
  - Analytics services that deliver telemetry data from your software and devices.
